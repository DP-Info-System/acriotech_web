Processing of refunds takes 7-10 business days.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', fontWeight: 700, color: '#0F172A', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>1.2 Post-Commencement Cancellations</h3>

            <li>Any non-cancellable third-party commitments made on the client's behalf (e.g., reserved cloud capacity, specialized software licenses).</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', color: '#475569', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>Upon cancellation, Acriotech will promptly deliver all completed work product and supporting documentation to the client. We strive to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>

            <li><strong>Cancellation Notice Period:</strong> A minimum of <strong>30 days written notice</strong> is required to cancel or downscale a dedicated team arrangement. This allows Acriotech to make appropriate staffing arrangements for the affected engineers.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Fees:</strong> Monthly retainer fees are non-refundable once the billing period has commenced. Partial-month cancellations are not eligible for a pro-rated refund unless the cancellation is due to a material breach by Acriotech.</li>
            <li><strong>Scaling Down:</strong> Clients may reduce the size of their dedicated team with 30 days notice. Any pre-paid fees for removed team members for the notice period are non-refundable but will be applied as a credit toward future services.</li>
